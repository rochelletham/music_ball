# Music Ball
This was my first [Processing](https://processing.org/) project! User can upload a mono soundfile and play with the panning & playrate of the soundfile depending on the ball's location
on the screen. 
#### Software: Processing (Java), Library: [Sound](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/sound/index.html)
